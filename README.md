Unobtrusive scripting adapter for jQuery
========================================

This unobtrusive scripting support file is developed for the Ruby on Rails framework, but is not strictly tied to any specific backend. You can drop this into any application to:

- force confirmation dialogs for various actions;
- make non-GET requests from hyperlinks;
- make forms or hyperlinks submit data asynchronously with Ajax;
- have submit buttons become automatically disabled on form submit to prevent double-clicking.

These features are achieved by adding certain ["data" attributes][data] to your HTML markup. In Rails, they are added by the framework's template helpers.

Full [documentation is on the wiki][wiki], including the [list of published Ajax events][events].

Requirements
------------

- [jQuery 1.8.x or higher][jquery];
- HTML5 doctype (optional).

If you don't use HTML5, adding "data" attributes to your HTML4 or XHTML pages might make them fail [W3C markup validation][validator]. However, this shouldn't create any issues for web browsers or other user agents.

Installation using the jquery-rails gem
------------

For automated installation in Rails, use the "jquery-rails" gem. Place this in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jquery-rails'
```

And run:

```shell
$ bundle install
```

Require both `jquery` and `jquery_ujs` into your application.js manifest.

```javascript
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
```

Installation using npm.
------------

Run `npm install --save jquery-ujs` to install the jquery-ujs package.

Installation using Rails and Webpacker
------------

If you're using [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) (introduced in [Rails 5.1](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html#optional-webpack-support)) to manage JavaScript assets, then you can add the jquery-ujs npm package to your project using the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) CLI.

```
$ yarn add jquery-ujs
```

Then, from any of your included files (e.g. `app/javascript/packs/application.js`, or from a JavaScript file imported by such a pack), you need only import the package for jquery-ujs to be initialized:

```js
import {} from 'jquery-ujs'
```

Installation using Bower
------------

Run `bower install jquery-ujs --save` to install the jquery-ujs package.

Usage
------------

Require both `jquery` and `jquery_ujs` into your application.js manifest.

```javascript
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
```

How to run tests
------------

Follow [this wiki](https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/wiki/Running-Tests-and-Contributing) to run tests.
